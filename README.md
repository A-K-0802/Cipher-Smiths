# Team Cipher-Smiths

## Objective
Our mission is to create a robust, intelligent, and user-friendly system for detecting cyber threats in network traffic. By leveraging the power of machine learning, this project aims to provide an advanced Intrusion Detection System (IDS) capable of identifying both common, known attacks and novel, zero-day threats in real-time. The system is designed to be easily managed through a simple web-based dashboard, making it accessible to security professionals and network administrators.

## Tech Stack

Frontend - HTML, CSS, JavaScript:	<br>
A dynamic and responsive web dashboard for visualization and user interaction.<br><br>
Backend: Python (Flask/FastAPI):<br>Serves as the application layer, managing data flow and exposing APIs for the frontend.<br><br>
ML Models:	XGBoost, Isolation Forest:<br>The core intelligence for threat detection. XGBoost for known attacks and Isolation Forest for anomalies.<br><br>
Libraries:	Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy:<br>Essential for data preprocessing, model training, and inference.<br><br>
Data:	UNSW-NB15 <br>
